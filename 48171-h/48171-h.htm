<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p>With the assistance of information that we have gained, being
a practical performer of acknowledged ability, we are about to fill up a
<i>hiatus</i> in theatrical history.</p>

<p>It is singular that, to the present day, save by one author of a valuable
work, now out of print, no other attempt has been made to illustrate
the origin, biography and character of a person so distinguished
and notorious as <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>. His name and his performances are familiar
to all ranks and ages; yet none have hitherto taken the trouble,
in this country or abroad, to make any inquiries regarding himself,
his family or connections. The &ldquo;studious Bayle&rdquo; is recorded to have
repeatedly sallied from his retreat, at the sound of the cracked trumpet,
announcing his arrival in Rotterdam; and we ourselves, who have
often hunted our favorite performer from street to street, saw the late
Mr. Windham, then one of the Secretaries of State, on his way from
Downing Street to the House of Commons, on a night of important
debate, pause like a truant boy until the whole performance was concluded,
to enjoy a hearty laugh at the whimsicalities of &ldquo;the motley
hero.&rdquo; But it is needless to particularize. Punch has</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i20">&ldquo;made our youth to laugh,</div>
<div class="i0">Until they scarcely could look out for tears;&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>while the old have stood by, &ldquo;delighted with delight&rdquo; of others, and
themselves, too, enjoying the ludicrous representation. Why the interest
has hitherto been limited to the period of representation, and
whether it has not in part arisen from inability to satisfy it, is not for
us to explain. We confine ourselves to an endeavor, in some degree,
to supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>The contrast between the neglect Mr. Punch has experienced, and
the industry employed in collecting particulars relating to other performers
of far less reputation, is remarkable. Nevertheless, it is undeniable
that his fame has spread &ldquo;without his stirring&rdquo; over all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
kingdoms of the civilized world. To use the wordy periphrasis of Dr.
Johnson,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;Let observation, with extensive view,</div>
<div class="i0">Survey mankind from China to Peru,&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>if it can, and it will everywhere behold Punch dispensing &ldquo;the luxury
of a laugh.&rdquo; It is literally true that some years ago he found his way
to Canton; and that since the South American Revolution he has
been seen even on the western side of the Andes. He is, perhaps,
himself in part to blame for the neglect we have noticed. Several of
the principal supporters of our theatres, in our own day, have given
their memoirs to the world, either by writing them with their own
hands, or by furnishing the materials to others; and the works of this
kind by dead actors, &ldquo;the forgotten of the stage,&rdquo; consist of many
volumes. Whether it has arisen from an absence of that vanity (may
we call it?) which has at times influenced his histrionic rivals, or from
a somewhat haughty reluctance on his part to gratify public curiosity,
we know not.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<span class="smaller">ORIGIN OF PUNCH IN ITALY.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Punch (whose original family name was probably <i>Pulcinella</i>)
first came into existence at Acerra, an ancient city at a short distance
from Naples. The date of this event is differently stated by authors
who have incidentally mentioned him, Riccoboni fixing it before the
year 1600, and Gimma and Signorelli after the commencement of the
seventeenth century. The words of Gimma are very precise, and as
he enters into particulars, it seems safe to rely upon his authority for
this important fact.</p>

<p>The performances, in which the actor was left to his own talents
and discretion in furnishing the dialogue, were once extremely popular
throughout Italy; but from the very nature of the representation,
it unluckily happens that not a single specimen has been handed down
to our time.</p>

<p>However, to pursue this topic would lead us away from the object
of our present inquiry. We take it for granted that Silvio Fiorillo
invented Pulcinella, and first introduced him as a variety in the list of
buffoons required to represent the impromptu comedies of Naples:
but, although he may date his separate existence from about the year
1600, it is a matter of much doubt whether he was not, in fact, only a
branch of a family of far greater antiquity. The discovery, in the
year 1727, of a bronze statue of a mime, called by the Romans <i>Maccus</i>,
has indeed led some antiquaries to the conclusion that he was, in fact,
Pulcinella under a different name, but with the same attributes, and
among them a hump-back and a large nose.</p>

<p>The dress, too, corresponds very much with the <i>motley</i> or parti-colored
habit of the clowns of our old dramatic poets. It is true that
the different hues have been arranged with greater regularity, and the
patches are of smaller size. The ordinary habiliments of Punch at the
present day, preserved by ancient usage, with his pointed fool&rsquo;s-cap,
bear a much nearer resemblance; and this is one circumstance that
evidences the strong family likeness between the Vice, Harlequin
and Pulcinella. Riccoboni represents the <i>ancient</i> Harlequin in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
dress composed of patches, as if his ragged clothes had been often
mended, and Goldoni speaks of him as originally a poor, foolish dolt.</p>

<p>According to Quadrio, in his &ldquo;Storia d&rsquo;ogni Poesia,&rdquo; the name of our
hero has relation to the length of his nose: he would spell it Pullicinello
from <i>Pulliceno</i>, which Mr. D&rsquo;Israeli translates &ldquo;turkey-cock,&rdquo; an
allusion to the beak of that bird. Baretti has it Pulcinella, because
that word in Italian means a hen-chicken, whose cry the voice of Punch
is said to resemble. Pollicenello, as it has also been written, in its
etymology from <i>pollice</i>, &ldquo;the thumb,&rdquo; goes upon the mistaken presumption
that his size was always diminutive, like that of our English
worthy, of cow-swallowing memory. The French <i>Ponche</i> has been
fancifully derived from no less a personage than Pontius Pilate of the
old Mysteries, whom, in barbarous times, the Christians wished to
abuse and ridicule. If we cannot settle the disputed point, it is very
evident that, in future, ingenuity and learning will be thrown away in
attempting further elucidation.</p>

<span class="smaller">ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF PUPPET-PLAYS IN ENGLAND.</span></h2>

<p>Before we proceed farther, it will be necessary to consider, briefly,
the antiquity and nature of puppet-plays in the old country. It is
the more proper to do so, because they form a branch of our drama
which has never been examined by the historians of our stage with as
much interest and industry as the subject deserves. When we mention
that no less a man than Dr. Johnson was of opinion that puppets
were so capable of representing even the plays of Shakspeare, that
Macbeth might be performed by them as well as by living actors, it
will be evident from such a fact only, that the inquiry is far from unimportant.
In connection with this opinion, and confirmatory of it, we
may add, that a person of the name of Henry Rowe, shortly before
the year 1797, did actually, by wooden figures, for a series of years, go
through the action of the whole of that tragedy, while he himself repeated
the dialogue which belongs to each of the characters.</p>

<p>Puppet-plays are of very ancient date in England; and, if they were
not contemporary with our Mysteries, they probably immediately succeeded
them.</p>

<p>The formidable rivalship of puppet-plays to the regular drama is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
established by the fact that the proprietors of the theatres in Drury
Lane, and near Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, formerly petitioned Charles II.
that a puppet-show stationed on the present site of Cecil Street in the
Strand, might not be allowed to exhibit, or might be removed to a
greater distance, as its attractiveness materially interfered with the
prosperity of their concerns. It is not unlikely that burlesque and
ridicule were sometimes aimed at the productions of the regular stage
by the exhibitors of &ldquo;motions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Powell&rsquo;s show was set up in Covent Garden, opposite to St. Paul&rsquo;s
Church; and the &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo; (No. 14) contains the letter of the sexton,
who complained that the performances of Punch thinned the congregation
in the church, and that, as Powell exhibited during the time
of prayers, the tolling of the bell was taken, by all who heard it, for
notice of the intended commencement of the exhibition. The writer
of the paper then proceeds, in another epistle, to establish that the
puppet-show was much superior to the opera of &ldquo;Rinaldo and Armida,&rdquo;
represented at the Haymarket, and to observe that &ldquo;too much encouragement
could not be given to Mr. Powell&rsquo;s skill in <i>motions</i>.&rdquo; A
regular parallel is drawn between the two, which ends most decidedly
in favor of Powell in every respect but the inferior point of the moral.</p>

<p>From these sources we collect, most distinctly, that the popularity
of Punch was completely established, and that he triumphed over all
his rivals, materially lessening the receipts at least at the Opera, if not
at the regular national theatres, and accomplishing at that period, by
his greater attractiveness, what Dennis, by his &ldquo;Essay on Operas after
the Italian manner,&rdquo; and other <i>critiques de profession</i>, had been unable
to effect. He could hardly have taken such firm possession of the
public mind if he had only recently emigrated from his native country.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Joseph Strutt, in his &ldquo;Sports and Pastimes of the People
of England,&rdquo; thus speaks of the puppet-shows in his time: &ldquo;In my
memory these shows consisted of a wretched display of wooden figures,
barbarously formed and decorated, without the least degree of taste
or propriety: the wires that communicated the motion to them appeared
at the top of their heads, and the manner in which they were
made to move evinced the ignorance and inattention of the managers.
The dialogues were mere jumbles of absurdities and nonsense, intermixed
with low, immoral discourses, passing between Punch and the
fiddler, for the orchestra rarely admitted of more than one minstrel;
and these flashes of merriment were made offensive to decency by the
actions of the puppet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>From whatever cause the change may have arisen, certain it is that
at present, in the ordinary exhibitions of &ldquo;Punch and Judy,&rdquo; the
breaches of decorum complained of by Mr. Strutt are rare and slight.</p>

<p>We have never seen less than two men concerned in these ambulatory
exhibitions: one to carry the theatre and use Punch&rsquo;s tin whistle,
and the other to bear the box of puppets and blow the trumpet. During
the performance the money is collected from the bystanders, and
far from agreeing with Mr. Strutt that the contributions are &ldquo;very
trifling,&rdquo; we have seen, for we have taken the pains to ascertain it, three,
four and five shillings obtained at each repetition; so that, supposing
only ten performances take place in a summer&rsquo;s day, the reward to the
two men, on an average, might be about a sovereign each. On one
occasion we remember to have seen three different spectators give sixpence,
besides the pennies elsewhere contributed, on which the collector
went back to the theatre and whispered the exhibitor, who immediately
made Punch thus address the crowd: &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,
I never yet played for sevenpence halfpenny, and I never will; so
good-morning.&rdquo; He then &ldquo;struck his tent&rdquo; and departed, pocketing
nearly two shillings, and excusing himself from going through the performance,
under pretence that all the contributions he had received
only amounted to sevenpence halfpenny.</p>

<span class="smaller">ANTIQUITY OF PUNCH IN AMERICA.</span></h2>

<p>In the preceding chapters we have spoken of the origin, progress
and high esteem held for Punch and puppet-plays throughout the
countries of Italy and England; and judging from our own personal
experience and actual knowledge, in still greater favor may Punch be
said to hold for himself amongst the fun-loving Americans. What
children&rsquo;s party is brought to a perfect state of merriment unless with
the greetings and comicalities of Mr. Punch?</p>

<p>Though for a while the tracing of the adventures and travels of Mr.
Punch throughout this land is lost, yet we have before us sufficient to
show that his family are of good antiquity, the <i>New York Gazette</i> of
Feb. 20th, 1739, having the following announcement:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow will be performed, in Mr. Holt&rsquo;s long room, the new
pantomime entertainment, in grotesque characters, called &lsquo;The Adventures
of Harlequin and Scaramouch; or, The Spaniard Trick&rsquo;d,&rsquo; to
which will be added an Optick, wherein will be represented in perspective
several of the most noted cities and remarkable places in
Europe and America, with a new Prologue and Epilogue addressed
to the town. To begin precisely at six o&rsquo;clock. Tickets to be had at
Mr. Holt&rsquo;s, at five shillings each.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ireland&rsquo;s history of the New York stage preserves the next earliest
record of mechanical puppets performed in this country. It refers to
the <i>New York Gazette</i> of August, 1747:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be seen at the house of Mr. Hamilton Hewetson, at the sign of
the Spread Eagle, near White Hall slip, Punch&rsquo;s opera, &lsquo;Bateman; or,
The Unhappy Marriage,&rsquo; with a fine dialogue between Punch and his
wife, Joan, acted by a set of lively figures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In August, 1749, the play of &ldquo;Whittington and his Cat&rdquo; was announced
to be acted in New York city by Punch&rsquo;s company of comedians,
and in the following year the same company, supposed to be
mechanical figures, were to have performed the &ldquo;Norfolk Tragedy; or,
The Babes in the Wood,&rdquo; along with &ldquo;Entertainments of Men and
Women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Passing on to the time within the memory of the present generation,
we find that Mr. Punch came into special favor about the year
1866, as may be gathered from the reports in the English newspapers
of that time, Manvers and others of England&rsquo;s best Punch and Judy
players having left its shores to try their fortunes in America&rsquo;s more
favored channels.</p>

<p>In 1874 the demand for puppets was so great that it became difficult
to meet the wants of the many professors that had decided to become
performers. Notwithstanding the growing number of actors, in
the fall of 1876 not one unemployed Punch and Judy performer could
be found in New York city.</p>

<p>As to the puppet-show of &ldquo;Punch and Judy,&rdquo; it never is looked at
by our people but as a mere joke; and a most effective part of that
joke is the ultimate triumph of the hero; without it the representation
would be not only &ldquo;flat and stale,&rdquo; but &ldquo;unprofitable.&rdquo; We have seen
it so, for we remember a showman on one occasion not merely receiving
little or no money, but getting lamentably pelted with mud, because,
from some scruple or other, he refused to allow the victory over
the Devil to Punch. Besides, it may surely deserve consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
whether, wicked as Punch unquestionably is, the Devil is not the worse
offender of the two, and, consequently, the more deserving of punishment.
If so, poetical justice is satisfied.</p>

<p>Recently an American showman has introduced a very famous popular
piece as a closing act to the comical tragedies of Mr. Punch, in
which our hero, after having gained a victory over the demon, is eventually
himself swallowed up by a great snake. (<i>See the Act for <span class="upright">Punch</span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE THEATRE AND THE ACTING OF THE PUPPETS.</span></h2>

<p>Having dwelt at some length on the antiquity and high popularity
of Mr. Punch, we will devote the whole of this chapter in explaining
to the reader how he may successfully arrange and work the figures,
with a description of the frames or Punch and Judy houses in which
the performer operates his troupe of puppets.</p>

<p>Portable frames, complete, ready for use, are advertised by the author
in the last pages of this work; yet the reader, if a genius, may
save half its cost by constructing for himself the little house. Obtain
four pieces of pine, eight feet long, two inches in diameter; let them
be planed on the four sides; divide each piece in the centre, and fix
thereon an hinge, with a bolt on the opposite side; thus the four
eight-feet pillars may be made to fold up to fit into any box or trunk
four feet in length. Next cut six cross-pieces, 31 inches long, for the
sides, two to be used for the centre, and four for the ends; next get
ready five lengths, 36 inches long, to make the cross-pieces for the
back and front of the frame, four to be fitted on the four ends, the remaining
one to form the cross-piece on which you screw a flat piece
of wood, six inches wide, to form the stage, which we advise to be
fixed up about 59 inches from the ground, the whole to be clamped
firmly together with twenty-two ordinary iron bolts and nuts. If
each joint is mortised, the skeleton structure will have a wonderful
degree of strength. To finish, cut a shelf from a ten-inch board, full
36 inches long; mortise two of the corners to fit or catch into the two
front pillars; this you lay on the two centre cross-pieces, which forms
you a snug interior shelf on which you lay all the figures that you use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
in the performance. A proscenium, cut out of thick cardboard, and
tastefully decorated or painted, should be hung in front of the stage.
This, with the calico covering that you wrap around the frame, completes
the structure, illustrations of which may be seen on our title-page
and next succeeding engraving.</p>

<p>It is generally known that the writer of this book owns the largest
and most complicated Punch and Judy theatre in the world, with its
six changes of scenery; and, although its plan of construction has
been kept secret, we think that to the readers of this work we ought
to convey some idea of its specialties. We therefore not only give
a description, but have caused our artist to make engravings of two
of its most important parts of construction. The theatre is near ten
feet in height, over six feet frontage, and the same distance in its depth
to back of stage. Below we give a description of the engraving.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i17" src="images/illus-017.png" width="600" height="495" alt="" />
<p class="longcaption">J, K is a side view of the little theatre; M forms a front view of an interior
water scene, which is located towards the back of the stage; the flies, five in
number, are painted green, with splashes of white to represent sea-foam; each
fly is attached to two small green cords through the holes at N, N; there are two
cross-pieces above, that traverse from the stage, front to back; on these are ten
hooks; the green cords are strung on to these hooks; the five flies are then
swung into motion, which, to the audience, represents a storm at sea. The ship
sails along once the whole length; but on its second or third journey it is wrecked;
the sails ruffle up, and it gradually sinks beneath the waves. When there are
two performers concealed in this theatre, the ship is made to meet another vessel
(<i>a steamer</i>); the two to collide; one is wrecked, the other sails away safely.
These ships are so constructed that they mechanically wreck at the will of the
performer. L, L are two of the pillars of the theatre; K is the upper cross-beam,
with four wooden pegs projecting out; J is a grooved board about five inches in
diameter, with holes bored to correspond with the pegs to fit secure on the cross-beam
K; A, B, C, D and E are half-circles, cut out to receive rollers containing
the drop scenery; F, F, F, F, F are grooves cut to receive the wings that are
placed in front of the drop scenery; H is the pulley; I shows section of pulley;
G shows pulley and cord fitted on to the roller at A. The five pulleys should not
be more than four inches in diameter. A should be the scene of a prison, B an
hotel scene, C the forest, D the Black Hills, and E the background. A front
drop scene can also be added, which does not stand located in the engraving.
The remaining portion of this theatre is made and bolted together after the plan
advised for the smaller frame. The theatre once properly built, each timber must
be legibly marked before taken apart, so that the performer may speedily rebuild
the same when wanted.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>Having thus fully explained how to construct a Punch&rsquo;s theatre, we
will now proceed to treat on</p>

<h3>THE CHOICE AND SELECTION OF PERFORMING FIGURES,</h3>

<p>of which there are two classes&mdash;the perfectly made and the imperfect.
The latter, which are chiefly importations from foreign countries, should
be studiously avoided by the performer. They may be distinguished
from the properly made puppets by their cramping the hand, their
shortness of dress bringing into special notice the arms of the performer
as he attempts to manipulate them above the stage. The desirable
genuine-made figures can only be safely secured by ordering them
from a dealer or maker that is himself, also, a Punch and Judy player.
A bona fide performer, of course, knows just how they ought to be
made, and prides himself on their perfectness, improvements and advantages
over those of the toy importers that deal in the productions
of novices, made for them at the cheapest rates; hence the reducing
of those essential parts of the dress that are of special advantage to
the performer. We draw the reader&rsquo;s attention to the address of the
dealer whose card will be found in the last pages of this book, and who
will supply you with correctly made figures, and has every appurtenance
and stage-requisite treated on in this work.</p>

<p>An operator can give a very fair show with an outfit of eight figures,
to which, from time to time, he should add others, until he has a
complete set, which are to be arranged on the inner shelf in his frame
in the following order:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Under his left hand, at the end of shelf, he lays the Snake Demon
and Little Dog; next to them the Sheriff, Doctor, Ghost, Negro, Negress,
Judy; on his right or other end Punch, Scaramouch, Dutchman,
Irishman, and Pretty Polly; over these he rests Dog Toby and Punch&rsquo;s
Baby in readiness for the opening acts. Amongst the figures he
should have a bell, the gallows, and three clubs, as sticks for Mr.
Punch. The box trick, coffin, and other stage properties should lie
on the ground near the performer&rsquo;s feet. Where there is but one
player to work the show, remember to put a stick in the hole of Mr.
Punch&rsquo;s head, and in several of the others. This greatly assists the
performer, and enables him to catch the figures up much quicker, and
prevents Mr. Punch from dropping down his head, as if weary.
Whilst one figure is up to view above the stage, the operator may
quickly adjust another figure by holding its head betwixt his chin
and breast, whilst he plants his hand beneath its dress.</p>

<p>The performer should educate himself to playing the acts both single-handed,
and also with the help of an assistant. Where convenient for two
performers to be inside the frame, the show, of course, can be gotten up
on a much more grand and extensive scale. Punch is always held
in the performer&rsquo;s right hand, and is always to be the hero in the tragedies,
and the most lively of all the puppets, and operated by the best
man of the two performers. The assistant player puts up a third figure
at some window or side corner to poke fun at Mr. Punch, and also
is a useful help by interesting the company at any gap in the performance
caused by the leading performer fixing his puppets ready for the
successive acts. The players must remember to give to each figure
genuine life-like motions, convey the impressive idea by shaking the
head or arms of each figure in turn, as they converse one with the
other. This advice is of special importance, and should be observed
by the players. On no account should Mr. Punch be allowed to remain
motionless, dull or stupid, with nothing to say or do. He is ever
to be the gayest of the gay, king and conqueror of all before him.
Once in view above the stage before the company, whilst waiting for
an act to commence or for a figure to come up, he thumps his club
down on the stage, throws it at the showman outside, dances, or sings
a verse of a song. After a figure has entered and announced to Mr.
Punch that he has a fine horse for Mr. Punch to ride on, Punch shows
his pleasure by running from end to end of the stage, to the company
appearing to enjoy taking note of every effort that is being made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
bring the horse in. Hector enters; the comical results relating thereto
are illustrated and described in the dialogue for Act I.</p>

<h3>ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SQUEAKER.</h3>

<p>Some writers have raised objections to the use of the instrument
called the Punch and Judy Squeaker, on account of the greater difficulty
in articulating the words used by Mr. Punch. From the earliest
times within the reach of our memory the familiar squeak of Mr. Punch
has always greeted our ear. We therefore say by all means let it so continue.
A little practice will soon enable you to articulate the sound of
words intelligibly, and until you are proficient in its use, the answer of
the other figure will convey the meaning. Thus, Punch, in his squeaking
voice, asks for the baby. Judy answers, &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Punch, you want the
baby, do you? Well, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s asleep, but I&rsquo;ll go and see.&rdquo; Let
the squeaker be (<i>a good one</i>) placed on the centre of the tongue, held
close to the roof of the mouth and the words spoken through it. It will
readily rest itself on the tongue when the answering voice is made.
The best squeakers are made of silver; they are fully four times thicker
in substance than those that are made of tin or zinc, hence they cannot
so easily be crushed up, and only require rebinding with tape about
once every year. A second squeaker should also be in the performer&rsquo;s
vest pocket for instant readiness in case squeaker No. 1 should be
dropped out of the performer&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>Having instructed the reader how to build a theatre, and traced the
history, with the character and deportment, of Mr. Punch, we shall
now proceed to place his performances upon record. It is time to do
so for the benefit of posterity; lest, as society gradually acquires a
more superfine polish than it even now possesses, it should be impossible,
hereafter, to print what is fortunately yet considered innocent
and harmless. Addison tells us that &ldquo;the merry people of the
world are the amiable,&rdquo; and in the language of &ldquo;a man forbid,&rdquo; we address
ourselves to those,</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>Portions of the following drama are founded upon the performances
of an old Italian Punch and Judy performer of the name of Piccini,
who has perambulated the towns and country hamlets of England for
the last forty or fifty years. Like the representations of our early
stage, it was not by him distinguished into acts and scenes, but the
divisions were easily made. The writer is a professional player of
Punch and Judy, and now gives the public, in this book, not only the
Italian Piccini&rsquo;s earlier introduction, but the records of his own experience,
with gleanings from that of other first-class players. The
whole now assumes a shape in which it may rival most of the theatrical
productions of the present era, whether by Poole, popular for his
&ldquo;Paul Pry,&rdquo; Peake for his puns, Planche for his poetry, Peacock for
his parodies or Payne for his plagiarisms.</p>

<p>Piccini lived in the classical vicinity of the West End of London, and
up to the time that ourselves left England (in 1869) was still travelling,
considering it &ldquo;no sin to labor in his vocation.&rdquo; He is thus described
by a writer in a discontinued periodical called the <i>Literary Speculum</i>,
which we quote because it is the only printed notice we have seen of
an individual so generally known. It is to be observed that the article
to which we are indebted was published many years ago, and the
author of it speaks of his own youth, when Piccini&rsquo;s age was &ldquo;as a lusty
winter, frosty but kindly,&rdquo; and before &ldquo;time, the old clock-setter,&rdquo; had
nearly let him run the whole length of his chain without winding him
up again. &ldquo;He (Piccini) was an Italian; a little thick-set man, with a
red, humorous-looking countenance. He had lost one eye, but the
other made up for the absence of its fellow by a shrewdness of expression
sufficient for both. He always wore an oil-skin hat and a
rough great-coat. At his back he carried a deal box, containing the
<i>dramatis personæ</i> of his little theatre, and in his hand the trumpet at
whose glad summons hundreds of merry, laughter-loving faces flocked
round him, with gaping mouths and anxious looks, all eager to renew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
their acquaintance with their old friend and favorite, Punch. The
theatre itself was carried by a tall man, who seemed a sort of sleeping
partner in the concern, or mere <i>dumb waiter</i> on the other&rsquo;s operations.&rdquo;
The <a href="#i3">woodcut</a> on our title-page precisely corresponds with this lively
description, making some allowance for the difference of age in the
master of the puppet-show; still, however, not too old to carry his
deal box and to blow an &ldquo;inspiring air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is one peculiarity about Piccini&rsquo;s puppets which deserves notice:
they were much better carved, the features having a more marked
and comic expression than those of his rivals. He brought most of
them over with him from Italy, and he complained that in England he
had not been able to find any workman capable of adequately supplying
the loss if by chance one of his figures had been broken or stolen.
Why his Punch was made to squint, or, at least, to have what is known
by the epithet of a swivel-eye, unless for the sake of humor or distinction,
does not appear.</p>

<p>Besides Piccini&rsquo;s representation, we have compared the following
pages with, and corrected them and made additions according to, the
text of our professional performances and the exhibitions of other
perambulatory <i>artistes</i> (as our neighbors term them) now flourishing.</p>

<p>The reader&rsquo;s attention should be specially directed to the acting
drama of the Persecuted Dutchman, in Mrs. Barrisnobes Hotel, and to
Punch&rsquo;s famous $25,000 Box Trick.</p>

<span class="smcap">Clown</span>, jolting up his head, says: <span class="upright">&ldquo;Yes; all dead.&rdquo;</span> <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, touching a
body, says: <span class="upright">&ldquo;Was that you?&rdquo;</span> He goes down for his club. <span class="smcap">Clown</span>

time, I think.&rdquo;</span> Hit, hit, and places it on the right of the stage. He now
discovers the <span class="smcap">Clown</span> at his antics. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> makes for him; stands him
up against the left pillar of the stage; makes thrusts at him with the end
of his club, counting, <span class="upright">&ldquo;One, two, three&mdash;e&mdash;e;&rdquo;</span> but every time the
three is pronounced the <span class="smcap">Clown</span> falls flat down, causing <span class="smcap">Punch</span> to miss
his mark. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> says, <span class="upright">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you now.&rdquo;</span> He spits against the post
of the stage, and rubs the <span class="smcap">Clown</span> against it. He counts, <span class="upright">&ldquo;One, two,
three&mdash;e&mdash;e.&rdquo;</span> This time pins the <span class="smcap">Clown</span> to the post; but the moment
the end of <span class="smcap">Punch&rsquo;s</span> club is removed, the <span class="smcap">Clown</span> darts away, giving <span class="smcap">Punch</span>
a lively knock on the back of the head&mdash;makes after to run off with some

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Do you know that Joe went down-town and knocked down
an old woman near sixty years old?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> He did!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Yes, he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joey.</span> Yes, and I would have knocked her down if she had been an
hundred and sixty years old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> (<i>giving <span class="smcap">Joey</span> a box on the ear</i>). Now, you would do no such
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joey.</span> Yes, I would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> Now, Joey, what was your father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joey.</span> Well they say that he was a good man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joey.</span> Then how was it, Mr. Valentine, that he did not make a gentleman
of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> Joey, you are getting a little too personal. (<i>turns to <span class="smcap">Freddy</span></i>)
Now, Freddy, what were you doing over the bridge last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> I went over to see my girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> And did you see her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> The old people would not let me into the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> Well, what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> I stood under a tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> What happened then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> I got wet all over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> Well, I suppose that it rained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> No, not that. Some say that it was perspiration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> And was it that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> No; I guess that it was dish-water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf</span>. Now, Freddy, supposing that a man were to dig down deep
into the earth, what would he come to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> To dirt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> But supposing that he were to dig down through the earth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> He would come out of the hole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> How is your aunty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> She has the chills and shakes at four o&rsquo;clock every afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> She has?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Yes; and I wish that she would shake out the half-dollar she
promised me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> Now, Joey and Freddy, do you see that trunk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joey.</span> I do. Is any one in there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perf.</span> Yes; a little girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Oh, do put me in there!</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Performer</span> places them in the trunk; a hushed voice is heard from <span class="smcap">Joey</span>
complaining that <span class="smcap">Freddy</span> will not give him any room. As the <span class="smcap">Performer</span>
opens the box, voice is suddenly increased in depth of tone; he closes it;

<p>&ldquo;How do you do? I was just going into the garden when papa
said you were here; and, of course, it doesn&rsquo;t do to keep company, it&rsquo;s
so rude. I&rsquo;m sixteen to-day, and have just left school, and everybody
says I&rsquo;ve made such rapid progress as regards my education. Do you
know they all say I&rsquo;ve grown so tall lately? Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
any objections to that if it wasn&rsquo;t for one reason, and that is&mdash;Well,
I hardly like to tell you the reason, either; but I have a young man,
and his name&rsquo;s Julius, and he&rsquo;s so awfully short himself his head
hardly comes above my shoulder; but then, you know, half a loaf&rsquo;s
better than no bread, and a short young man&rsquo;s better than none at all.
Talking of Julius, I will tell you something. The other evening we were
strolling up-town together, and Julius is awfully generous&mdash;he&rsquo;d give
me anything. Said he to me, &lsquo;Adelina, supposing I was to offer you
a present, would you accept one?&rsquo; Says I, &lsquo;Oh, certainly!&rsquo; Accordingly
we went into a store together, and while we were looking at the
things, what should the young man do who stood behind the counter,
but he came all the way round, took Julius by the shoulder. &lsquo;There,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;leave the things alone, and let your mamma pick what she
likes.&rsquo; Oh! I was awfully confused, and poor Julius, he didn&rsquo;t know
which way to look. But when I got my present, what do you think
that was? Oh, such a splendid pair of new shoes! But when I got
home I found the young shopman had made such a foolish mistake&mdash;he&rsquo;d
wrapped up eights, and everybody knows I only take twos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our Artist has given us Illustrations of four of the
Leading Marionette Puppets. They are of peculiar construction,
and differ from the Punch and Judy Troupe in
that the Performer is standing over instead of beneath
them. They are worked by each having five or more invisible
silken cords, terminating in an instrument held
in the hands of the Performer. Their feet, hands and
head go through all the life-like motions of living actors.
The smallest are twenty-four inches, and the largest
made are forty-two inches in height. <span class="smcap">Professor Judd</span>
of New York, who manufactures and has them in stock,

<p>Being a Systematic Compendium of the necessary Rules for attaining Proficiency
in Reading and Speaking. With copious and interesting examples.</p></blockquote>

<p>This treatise on Elocution and Oratory has been prepared with a strict regard to
practical utility, by a favorite tragedienne of the stage. By attention to its rules the
learner may rapidly acquire the art of reading aloud with due emphasis, and of
expressing himself in a set speech, or a recitation, with propriety. Though chiefly
designed for social purposes, it will also prove a safe guide for those who wish to
establish a well founded professional reputation, either as readers, speakers, or actors.</p>
